   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Input of package
===============================

This section will tell you know about input of this package, it will consist of text files and cycle time.

Text Files
-------------------------------
Input files of this package is text file (.txt). When you want to use this package You need to prepare a text file in the following format:

 * line 1: number n of tasks
 * lines 2 - n+1: integer task times
 * lines n+2, ‚Ä¶, last line: direct precedence relations in form "i,j"

An example of a properly formatted text file is show below.

.. figure:: /images/input.png

Cycle time
-------------------------------
When you run the function, it shows message ‚ÄúEnter the cycle time‚Äù. You must enter the cycle time for the function to be able to solve the problem.

 * lcr, rpw, comsoal, u_ga ü†í Cycle time must larger than maximum processing time
 *	parallel_ga ü†í Maximum processing time cann't exceed twice the cycle time

An example of cycle time from the image above is:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 25  75
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center

   * - Function
     - Cycle time
   * - lcr, rpw, comsoal, u_ga
     - Max processing time is 1.1 so cycle time is larger or equal 1.1 
   * - parallel_ga
     - 1.Max processing time is 1.1 so cycle time is not less than 1.1/2 = 0.55 

       2.Workstation can be duplicated only if the task time of one of the tasks 
       
       assigned to its exceeds the cycle time
